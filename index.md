<span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
I am a final year Masters student in Engineering Artificial Intelligence under the College of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, where I focus on machine learning and computer vision. I am advised by [Dan Boneh](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/). My current focus is on Deep Learning for computer vision and its applications in medical imaging and Healthcare.

<span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
Prior to joining CMU, I completed my Bachelors (Hons) in Software Engineering May 2024 from The ICT University In Cameroon. 
<!-- where I built Catan, a CPU scheduling framework for Robotics & AR/VR. I was advised by [Radhika Mittal](http://radhikam.web.illinois.edu/) and [Brighten Godfrey](https://pbg.cs.illinois.edu/). In the summer of 2021, I interned at Microsoft Research with the [RFI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/) group, where I worked with [Ranveer Chandra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/ranveer/) and [Anirudh Badam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/anbadam/).  -->

<!-- <span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
A little more history - I received my bachelors degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi in 2018. I pursued an internship with [Dina Katabi](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/dina-katabi) in the summer of 2018, during which I worked on 
[Emerald](https://www.emeraldinno.com/).

<span style="font-family:'Candara Light';">
Apart from work, I enjoy travelling, reading and watching documentaries.
